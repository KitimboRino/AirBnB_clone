1. **What is HTML?**
   - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of web pages.

2. **How to create an HTML page:**
   - An HTML page is created by using a text editor (like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Atom) to write HTML code. A basic HTML document includes a document type declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`), an opening and closing `<html>` tag, `<head>` and `<body>` sections, and various other elements to structure and define content.

3. **What is a markup language:**
   - A markup language is a system for annotating text to give instructions regarding its presentation or structure. HTML uses tags to mark elements within the document.

4. **What is the DOM:**
   - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document. The DOM can be manipulated with scripts to dynamically update the content, structure, and style of a webpage.

5. **What is an element/tag:**
   - An HTML element is a building block that represents different parts of a web page. It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, `<p>` is a paragraph element.

6. **What is an attribute:**
   - An attribute provides additional information about HTML elements. It is always included in the opening tag and consists of a name and a value. For example, in `<a href="https://example.com">`, "href" is an attribute.

7. **How does the browser load a webpage:**
   - When a user enters a URL, the browser sends a request to the web server, which responds with HTML and other resources (like CSS, JavaScript, images). The browser then parses and renders the HTML, constructs the DOM, fetches and applies styles, and finally executes scripts.

8. **What is CSS:**
   - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines how elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or in other media.

9. **How to add style to an element:**
   - Styles can be added to elements using CSS. This can be done inline (within the HTML tag), internally (using a `<style>` tag in the document head), or externally (linking to a separate CSS file).

10. **What is a class:**
   - A class is a way to apply a set of styles to multiple elements. It is defined in the HTML using the `class` attribute and can be targeted in CSS to apply specific styling.

11. **What is a selector:**
   - In CSS, a selector is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements. It can be an element selector (e.g., `p`), a class selector (e.g., `.myClass`), an ID selector (e.g., `#myID`), or a more complex selector.

12. **How to compute CSS Specificity Value:**
   - Specificity is a measure of how specific a selector is. It is calculated based on the number and types of selectors used in a CSS rule. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, and element selectors.

13. **What are Box properties in CSS:**
   - Box properties in CSS control the layout and dimensions of an element's box. These include properties like `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and others, influencing the space an element occupies and how it interacts with other elements.
